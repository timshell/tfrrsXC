tfrrsXC

Using data from TFRRS XC races of a particular season, this program will look how athletes around a certain time did on courses throughout the season.

The interface should be an input athlete's name and a particular race. Then, the program will look at all the runners within a certain epsilon (maybe 30 seconds?). Then, the program will look at all these runners and their times when they raced the same race as the input person. The program will compare the times of these runners on the courses and see the median/mean difference in time# tfrrsXC
